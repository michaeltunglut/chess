# **Python Chess Project**
A Chess Engine made in Python meant to be used for a chess analysis website/tool.  
Currently using PyGame as the interface just to see if the engine works.

## **To-Do**
1) Bug Fixes:
*  Queen able to move orthogonally when blocking checkmate even though it shouldn't
*  Probably more

2) Testing to see if there's any other bugs

3) An actual Interface on a browser
  
4) Implementing analysis tools on said browser interface

## **Dependencies**
* Numpy
* PyGame
* Stockfish
